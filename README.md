# light

It's a little window that has a slide button that talks to the program light.
Light is a command line tool that changes screen brightness and you have to put in a command into the command line, something like Light -S 25..

Instead you could keybind this to a certain key so it opens up and then you can easily change the screen brightness if you use a bloat-free or little machine.

## todo

make icon that has a material looking moon and something like that, maybe a vial that lights up and looks like the one from lord of the rings and animate it

have a loading screen with said icon

I want to have a text tab on the program that shows the current and the estimated brigthness on the slider.

keybindings 

add the actual functionality it, I havent implemented it into the current program but i have the code to change the brightness.

stylesheet, make it look slick and good maybe material looking

every 100 uses i ask people to buy me a cup of coffee like the blogs do.

maybe create a settings menu where you could change the color scheme, or maybe take the colors from .xresources

Probably wont but have the colors adjust based on the brightness of the room from the camera (no spy i swear)

refractor and minimize the code so that it works as well but is clean

publish it somewhere into maybe arch repository if i can



## requirements

python 
PyQt5
